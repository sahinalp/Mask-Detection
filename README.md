# Mask-Detection
 
A pre-trained model whose name is SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320, was trained with using the Python Tensorflow library to identify people who wear masks and those who do not, in order to develop a system that can quickly and accurately detect whether people are wearing masks.  The dataset which contains masked and unmasked faces in Kaggle was labeled with using labelImg to do training and the labels are inside of the Labels file. As a result of training, mAP value is 0.634 and AR value is 0.689.
